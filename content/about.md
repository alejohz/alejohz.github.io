I am a determined and resourceful individual with skills in programming, data science, and machine learning. I really enjoy doing exercise, swimming, biking, running and triatlhon. I also enjoy cooking and trekking up high mountains. This is a picture of me in Nevado Santa Isabel around Manizales Colombia.

### About this page

This page tries to compile some nice demos i have developed over the years, some are only links to github repos and others have been deployed with free services. 

Special mention to ElephantSQL, Glitch, Github for their amazing free tiers that allowed me to deploy some of these demos.
